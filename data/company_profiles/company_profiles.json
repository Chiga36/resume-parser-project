He has completed his Master\u2019s in Business Administration (MBA) and earlier worked with Xseed Education, with five years of experience in the education industry. He has always been obsessed with improving efficiencies through better organization in every aspect of life. Moreover, his stint with the highly unorganized educational industry triggered in him the idea of organizing it through an exclusive e-marketplace for educational institutions. He observed the need for bridging the gap between manufacturers and educational institutions to improve their business efficiencies by providing better communication between them. This led to the conception of the exclusive e-marketplace, MyVerkoper.
